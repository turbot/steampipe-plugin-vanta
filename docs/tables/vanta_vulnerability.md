# Table: vanta_vulnerability - Query Vanta Vulnerabilities using SQL

Vanta is a security and compliance automation platform that continuously monitors your infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. The vulnerability management feature aggregates findings from multiple sources including GitHub Dependabot, AWS ECR image scanning, and GCP Artifact Registry scanning, providing a unified view with SLA tracking and remediation workflows.

## Table Usage Guide

The `vanta_vulnerability` table provides insights into security vulnerabilities detected across your integrated services. As a security engineer, explore vulnerability details through this table, including severity levels, SLA deadlines, fix availability, and deactivation status. Utilize it to track overdue vulnerabilities, identify fixable issues, and monitor deactivated findings that may need reactivation.

## Examples

### Basic info
Explore all vulnerabilities with their severity and SLA status.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  severity,
  cvss_severity_score,
  remediate_by_date,
  is_fixable,
  integration_id
from
  vanta_vulnerability;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  severity,
  cvss_severity_score,
  remediate_by_date,
  is_fixable,
  integration_id
from
  vanta_vulnerability;
```

### List overdue vulnerabilities
Identify vulnerabilities that have exceeded their SLA deadline and require immediate attention.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  severity,
  remediate_by_date,
  days_until_due,
  integration_id,
  package_identifier
from
  vanta_vulnerability
where
  is_overdue = true
  and deactivation_reason is null
order by
  days_until_due asc;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  severity,
  remediate_by_date,
  days_until_due,
  integration_id,
  package_identifier
from
  vanta_vulnerability
where
  is_overdue = 1
  and deactivation_reason is null
order by
  days_until_due asc;
```

### List critical and high severity vulnerabilities
Focus on the most severe vulnerabilities that pose the greatest risk.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  severity,
  cvss_severity_score,
  remediate_by_date,
  is_fixable,
  integration_id,
  external_url
from
  vanta_vulnerability
where
  severity in ('CRITICAL', 'HIGH')
  and deactivation_reason is null
order by
  case severity
    when 'CRITICAL' then 1
    when 'HIGH' then 2
  end,
  cvss_severity_score desc nulls last;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  severity,
  cvss_severity_score,
  remediate_by_date,
  is_fixable,
  integration_id,
  external_url
from
  vanta_vulnerability
where
  severity in ('CRITICAL', 'HIGH')
  and deactivation_reason is null
order by
  case severity
    when 'CRITICAL' then 1
    when 'HIGH' then 2
  end,
  cvss_severity_score desc;
```

### List vulnerabilities with fixes available
Identify vulnerabilities that can be remediated immediately because a fix exists.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  severity,
  remediate_by_date,
  integration_id,
  package_identifier,
  external_url
from
  vanta_vulnerability
where
  is_fixable = true
  and deactivation_reason is null
order by
  case severity
    when 'CRITICAL' then 1
    when 'HIGH' then 2
    when 'MEDIUM' then 3
    when 'LOW' then 4
  end;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  severity,
  remediate_by_date,
  integration_id,
  package_identifier,
  external_url
from
  vanta_vulnerability
where
  is_fixable = 1
  and deactivation_reason is null
order by
  case severity
    when 'CRITICAL' then 1
    when 'HIGH' then 2
    when 'MEDIUM' then 3
    when 'LOW' then 4
  end;
```

### Count vulnerabilities by severity
Analyze the distribution of vulnerabilities across severity levels.

```sql+postgres
select
  severity,
  count(*) as vulnerability_count,
  count(*) filter (where is_overdue and deactivation_reason is null) as overdue_count,
  count(*) filter (where is_fixable and deactivation_reason is null) as fixable_count
from
  vanta_vulnerability
group by
  severity
order by
  case severity
    when 'CRITICAL' then 1
    when 'HIGH' then 2
    when 'MEDIUM' then 3
    when 'LOW' then 4
    else 5
  end;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  severity,
  count(*) as vulnerability_count,
  sum(case when is_overdue = 1 and deactivation_reason is null then 1 else 0 end) as overdue_count,
  sum(case when is_fixable = 1 and deactivation_reason is null then 1 else 0 end) as fixable_count
from
  vanta_vulnerability
group by
  severity
order by
  case severity
    when 'CRITICAL' then 1
    when 'HIGH' then 2
    when 'MEDIUM' then 3
    when 'LOW' then 4
    else 5
  end;
```

### Count vulnerabilities by integration source
Understand which integrations are contributing the most vulnerabilities.

```sql+postgres
select
  integration_id,
  count(*) as total_vulnerabilities,
  count(*) filter (where deactivation_reason is null) as active_vulnerabilities,
  count(*) filter (where is_overdue and deactivation_reason is null) as overdue_vulnerabilities
from
  vanta_vulnerability
group by
  integration_id
order by
  active_vulnerabilities desc;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  integration_id,
  count(*) as total_vulnerabilities,
  sum(case when deactivation_reason is null then 1 else 0 end) as active_vulnerabilities,
  sum(case when is_overdue = 1 and deactivation_reason is null then 1 else 0 end) as overdue_vulnerabilities
from
  vanta_vulnerability
group by
  integration_id
order by
  active_vulnerabilities desc;
```

### List deactivated vulnerabilities
Review vulnerabilities that have been ignored or deactivated.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  severity,
  deactivation_reason,
  deactivated_by,
  deactivated_on_date,
  case
    when is_deactivated_indefinitely then 'Indefinite'
    else to_char(deactivated_until_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD')
  end as reactivates_on,
  integration_id
from
  vanta_vulnerability
where
  deactivation_reason is not null
order by
  deactivated_until_date asc nulls last;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  severity,
  deactivation_reason,
  deactivated_by,
  deactivated_on_date,
  case
    when is_deactivated_indefinitely = 1 then 'Indefinite'
    else date(deactivated_until_date)
  end as reactivates_on,
  integration_id
from
  vanta_vulnerability
where
  deactivation_reason is not null
order by
  deactivated_until_date asc;
```

### List deactivated vulnerabilities with fix now available
Identify vulnerabilities that were deactivated but now have a fix available and should be reconsidered.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  severity,
  deactivation_reason,
  deactivated_until_date,
  integration_id,
  package_identifier
from
  vanta_vulnerability

  deactivation_reason is not null
  and is_fixable = 1
order by
  case severity
    when 'CRITICAL' then 1
    when 'HIGH' then 2
    when 'MEDIUM' then 3
    when 'LOW' then 4
  end;
```
